# I am right here.

Welcome to my site. Here you will find the various endings and beginnings of my creative work and various projects I have had the pleasure of participating in and generating. In my capacity as a creator in the Canadian arts community, I have had the fortune of working during COVID-19 with several commissions and residencies in varying artistic formats from coast to coast. The work I make and participate in is often interdisciplinary and genre-stretching asking my collaborators, as well as my audiences, to bend the limits of their predisposed notions around theatre, dance, and individuality on stage, screen, or behind the scenes. As a Queer Woman of Colour, the teams I assemble are with people that have similar identity and beliefs to mine; the gumption to innovate archaic and outdated practices/methods of creation and presentation, the understanding and power that representation holds in what we consume, and those who believe in the power of art.

**artistic statement**

Straddling sincerity and mockery, Tia Ashley Kushniruk's (亚 女弟) artistic milieu swings wildly from honesty to parody, indelicately proclaiming the hypocrisies of what it really means to be a person living today. Not shying away from informal performance art, 5 minute stand-up sets, to high end kpop light shows, Kushniruk's work cross examines the confusing toxic barrage of what a contemporary western identity is with her own lived experience of being a 1st generation queer mixed race Chinese-Canadian from a working class family. Key to Kushniruk's work is her ability to place nightmarish existential horrors into live stage experiences. In her 2020 work *monolith,* Tia examines consent, command, obedience, and violence through the relationship between a director and their subordinate in a 'groundhog day' loop, clouding the audience into a distrust of both players in the space. Who actually has power, and how far will someone go to show that power over the other? \
\
Kushniruk's adaptable artistry is crafted through an encyclopedic lens of current pop-culture, high risk/high reward style theatre making, and her dynamically magnetic stage presence and poetic physical vibrancy. As the broader realm of Canadian art continues further into reflective pieces of passive somber beauty, Kushniruk's work is like a flash bomb going off in a dark closet; violent, shocking, blinding, and potentially able to make you rethink why you thought testing a flash bomb in a closet was a good idea in the first place.

**biography** 

My name is Tia Ashley Kushniruk (亚 女弟) and I am a queer woman of Chinese-Eastern European settler heritage from the Treaty 6 Territory of Amiskwaciwâskahikan/Edmonton. I am a celebrated interdisciplinary dance artist who has represented Edmonton across Canada and around the globe. My creative body of work is vast in terms of medium and inspiration; I am primarily a dance artist, however I am also an animator, illustrator, filmmaker and writer.  

I sought advanced-level training in contemporary dance at the School of the Toronto Dance Theatre, where I graduated from in 2017. While at the school, I received the Kathryn Ash Scholarship (2016), and was nominated for the Hnatyshyn Prize (2016). Shortly after graduating, I was named one of NOW Magazine’s Top Breakthrough Stage Artists in 2017 (Toronto). I have continued training through various workshops and intensives, including recently at One Clown North, led by Jon Turner of Mump and Smoot.

I am a highly sought after dance artist, touring with companies across Canada and the world (Colombia, the U.S.A., Israel, France, Austria). I performed with the Toronto Dance Theatre under the artistic direction of Christopher House from 2017 - 2019, and in that time was mentioned by name in a review in the Globe and Mail (Toronto) and was nominated for a 2017 DORA Mavor Moore Award for Best Ensemble. I have been a company member with Shay Kuebler/RSA (Vancouver) since 2018, and have worked with renowned choreographers including: Peggy Baker (Toronto), Benjamin Kamino (Toronto/Montreal), Antony Hamilton (Melbourne, Australia), Paul Andre-Fortier (Montreal/London, England), Aria Evans (Toronto), Susie Burpee (Toronto), and Jaz Fairy J. Adina Simone (Toronto). In 2018, I was the Canadian Ambassador at the Beijing International Dance Festival, performing a work by Calgary-based Christianne Ullmark. I have been affiliated with the Cirque Du Soleil since 2013 and am a long-time collaborator of Jake W. Hastey (Toy Guns Dance Theatre). 

I have a strong interdisciplinary vision as a creator, and my work has been presented and commissioned throughout Alberta and across Canada. In 2020/2021, I was Catalyst Theatre’s (Edmonton) inaugural CONFLUENCE Fellow, and was commissioned by Mile Zero (Edmonton) to create my first large-scale work entitled *monolith* (2021). I have produced numerous dance films, including *A Geography Of Queer Woundings* (2020) commissioned as a part of Springboard Performance’s Fluid Fest (Calgary) and was subsequently reviewed in The Dance Current. In 2020, I was commissioned by Adeleid (Toronto) to create a short animated film entitled *blue collar/2050* which was presented at the NAC in Ottawa. Other recent commissions include: a work on the second year students at The School of TDT (Toronto), and a work on the students at SGSDance (Edmonton). I have also served as an outside eye and dramaturg for several dance works, including *basin* (2022, Kate Stashko, Edmonton), *BABY* (2022, Calder White, Vancouver), *STOP!?* (2022, Eilish Shin-Culhane, Toronto), and *pliant spaces* (2020, Sarah Wong, Vancouver). Additionally I have been the co-director and co-curator of Edmonton-based digital dance festival Dancing in the Park Online (2020-2022), which is now entering its 3rd season. 

My research has been supported by the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, and the Canada Council for the Arts, since 2014.
