# I am right here.

Welcome to my site. Here you will find the various endings and beginnings of my creative work and various projects I have had the pleasure of participating in and generating. In my capacity as a creator in the Canadian arts community, I have had the fortune of working during Covid-19 with several commissions and residencies in varying artistic formats from coast to coast. The work I make and participate in is often interdisciplinary and genre-stretching asking my collaborators, as well as my audiences, to bend the limits of their predisposed notions around theatre, dance, and individuality on stage, screen, or behind the scenes. As a Queer Woman of Colour, the teams I assemble are with people that have similar identity and beliefs to mine; the gumption to innovate archaic and outdated practices/methods of creation and presentation, the understanding and power that representation holds in what we consume, and those who believe in the power of art.

 If you are 'here', I encourage you to click around - it is a website after all ;)

Enjoy your stay,  and I welcome your return.

**artistic statement**

I am fascinated with the 4th wall. My stories consistently play with the performer/audience relationship that exists with visual storytelling. As a mixed race person, I am severely aware of the ways in which I can present(represent) myself in a space, and I am continuously reminded of my own inconsistencies as, again, someone of mixed racial presentation. My work tends to invoke individual examination in the viewer by coaxing them in with something familiar to ease them into a space of play, and then shocking them with the violence of their passive witnessing. My work can be violent, graphic, and mean-spirited; I craft my narratives to force an audience to feel the same amount of uncomfortability my characters do. I do not make Art as Therapy. My motive is to show you that your Fictions have Consequences.
