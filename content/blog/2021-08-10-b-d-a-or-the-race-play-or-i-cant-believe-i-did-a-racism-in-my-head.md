# b/d/a *OR* The Race Play *OR* 'I can't believe I did a racism! (In my head)' 

*b/d/a **OR** The Race Play **OR** 'I can't believe I did a racism! (In my head)'* is a Physical-theatre Play co-written by Tia Ashley Kushniruk, Shammy (Shamsa) Belmore, Jocelyn Mah, and Clarke Blair, with support from Catalyst Theatre's CONFLUENCE Fellowship in Edmonton AB. 

This work follows three characters in a perfect sitcom world solving a problem with rent when the actors begin switching roles and ultimately reveal the racial biases underneath each said character, and between each other, culminating in a posed question to the audience - "What would you do?"

In 3 Acts, *b/d/a **OR** The Race Play **OR** 'I can't believe I did a racism! (In my head)'* is a work that examines colour blind casting and the stories that we continue to tell ourselves to make everything all right. 

*b/d/a **OR** The Race Play **OR** 'I can't believe I did a racism! (In my head)'* requires a technical residency and two additional research periods before presentation. This work is not classified as 'Dance', rather 'Physical Theatre'.
