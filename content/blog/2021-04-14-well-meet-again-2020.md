# we'll meet again (2020) 

*Commissioned dance film by* the.response for Dance Cafe's presentation in Dancing On the Edge 2020. 

A single long take brings us to a solitary room, in a bomb shelter with a mysterious package that you failed to deliver. Inspired by the First Person Story Genre in video games, *we'll meet again* is an uncanny nightmare into a situation that you had never hoped you would be in. 

Written & performed by Tia Kushniruk, Co-writer & voice actor Ileanna Cheladyn, Direction & camera operator Colin Kushniruk,  Music Jon Kereliuk,  Voice actor Daria Mikhaylyuk,  Live sound mixing by Emma Kushniruk,  Light & Prop Wrangling by Brian Kushniruk.
