C﻿reated with Rizwan Mohiuddin 

't﻿iktok parody dance show' is exactly what it sounds like. Playing off of short attention spans, and the tendency for tiktok to show potentially jarring/related work, this piece brings to life rhythm, shock-comedy, and (of course) dance, to comment upon our increasingly shortening attention spans and the range of images we see. 

This work will premiere at Found Festival in Edmonton AB July 3-6, 2023
