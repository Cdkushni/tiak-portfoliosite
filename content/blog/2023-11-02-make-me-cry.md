**'﻿make me cry'** is an existential solo exploration into the psyche of our titular artist (tia): What does it mean to be the end result of a fetish versus participating in one? What happens when the public self follows into the private life? And, can abstraction belong to those who aren’t white?  A performance lecture using dance, clown, anecdote and performance theory, the audience is delved into the minstrelsy that accompanies BIPOC artists creating 'valuable' work for the consuming public.
