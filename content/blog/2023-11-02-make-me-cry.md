'﻿make me cry' is a solo work inspired by/in response to the durational group work 'make banana cry' by Andrew Tay and Stephen Thompson. An existential exploration into the psyche of our titular artist (tia), the audience is delved into the horror and ambiguity of what it means to be the end result of a fetish versus participating in one, and the minstrelsy that accompanies BIPOC artists creating 'valuable' work for the consuming public.
