# Illustration Commissions

I create Illustrations using Procreate, and animations using Flipaclip. 

Below is a list of companies/artists that I have had the pleasure of creating illustration commissions for. Rights of the illustrations belong to the commissioner:  

* TwoBig Steps Collective *Departures*, Poster Design and Visual Artist (2021)
* Shay Kuebler / Radical System Art,  Logo Design (2021)
* Plastic Orchid Factory 2020/2021 Season, *Fever Dreams* 

  * Click [here](http://plasticorchidfactory.ca/) to see the illustrations online. Click [here](https://plastic-orchid-factory.square.site/product/fever-dreams/18) to purchase your very own copy of *Fever Dreams.*
