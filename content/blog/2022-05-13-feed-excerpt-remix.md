FEED (excerpt.remix) is a work about youth, violence and control. What starts as the end of a night of debauchery, quickly escalates into a nightmare fuelled by indulgence and mania, resulting in an inevitable catastrophe that asks, how far would you go to feel like you are in control? 

The use of violence in this work is something I take very seriously. As someone with intersecting oppressions, I didn’t want to imply that violence has implicitly been a part of this existence. However, some of the most violent things that have happened to me were due to my identity. The 'violence' in this work is an ever changing beast, shapeshifting between subliminal, objective, overstimulating and even quietly residing in the corner.  

This work was built in 9 days with the 2nd year class at the School of TDT, for Momentum 2022.
