# *if the love leaves/si el amor se vas* (2019)

# Created in Collaboration with Fernando Camacho

# Presented at Festival Internacional Nómada 2020, El Salvador

*if the love leaves/si el amor ce vas* is a duet about an immediate aftermath. Two strangers happen upon each other in the same stage of shock. Feeling mutual camaraderie, they explore how to deal with loss through consolation, grief, intimacy, and offerings that they give to the other, and personally inflict upon themselves. *if the love leaves/si el amor se va*, asks how do you heal when the present is passing, how far you are willing to go to make it back to yourself, and if it is even possible. 

This work was created and was shown with Fernando Camacho and Tia Kushniruk performing at The Winchester St Theatre in Toronto ON CAN. It premiered internationally at *Festival Internacional Nómada* in El Salvador in 2020 with Ryan Kostinyuk and José David Cerda performing.\
