O﻿riginally called 'it lives in the fifth' 

F﻿ULCRUM is a collaboration between Christianne Ullmark/Creator/Director and Tia/Interpreter of the philosophy and rules associated with the 5th Dimension as an improvisational structure and text - originally devised by Christianne Ullmark. 

P﻿laying with two objects in the space, our interpreter conducts different tipping points/transitions between the space that exists physically/metaphysically to incite a feeling of a liminal horizon in the viewer. 

O﻿riginally created 5 years ago in Toronto, FULCRUM is also an exploration between the evolution of dancer and choreographer - the ever changing dynamic between a remount VS a remaster - and how to succumb to change.
