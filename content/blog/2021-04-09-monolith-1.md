# monolith (*film)*

Made possible by The Canada Council for the Arts and The Alberta Foundation for the Arts, *Monolith* illustrates how women are exploited by powerful figures, oftentimes under the guise of good intentions. The main character, Subject 71 is confined to an existence where she must meet the expectations and cater to the demands of The Monitor: a narcissistic and malicious being whose masked face continues to glare with manipulative expression. The Monitor’s commands may be delivered with grace but are in fact insane and inhumane. Subject 71 has no choice but to smile and appease. Her own existence, purpose, and dreams are directly tied to The Monitor’s whims and can be taken away at any moment.

The themes in *Monolith* speak to the experience of many female artists who are placed in situations where they are expected to obey those in higher positions without asking “why?” or even “is this appropriate?” Performed by Kushniruk herself, the sentiment is drawn from her own experiences as a professional dancer.

*PRAISE FOR MONOLITH*

“... I loved the rhythm of it, the intimacy of it, the bold lighting, bold contrast... I was surprised by how deeply I felt for the monotonous moments- and connected with the small (but giant) shifts within the containment.”

“CCA fund Tia more.”

“...very compelling, it was like a contemporary art Black Mirror. The design was very high level, such clear images in low light, kudos to the lighting team and camera crew...”

“...it was unlike any dance film I’ve seen.”
