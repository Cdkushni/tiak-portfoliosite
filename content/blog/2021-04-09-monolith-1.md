# Monolith (*film)*

Made possible by The Canada Council for the Arts and The Alberta Foundation for the Arts, *Monolith* illustrates how women are exploited by powerful figures, oftentimes under the guise of good intentions. The main character, Subject 71 is confined to an existence where she must meet the expectations and cater to the demands of The Monitor: a narcissistic and malicious being whose masked face continues to glare with manipulative expression. The Monitor’s commands may be delivered with grace but are in fact insane and inhumane. Subject 71 has no choice but to smile and appease. Her own existence, purpose, and dreams are directly tied to The Monitor’s whims and can be taken away at any moment.

The themes in *Monolith* speak to the experience of many female artists who are placed in situations where they are expected to obey those in higher positions without asking “why?” or even “is this appropriate?” Performed by Kushniruk herself, the sentiment is drawn from her own experiences as a professional dancer.

The character of The Monitor, a face-mirroring animation, was created by animator Kristen Innes Stambolic and is heavily inspired by the character Hexadecimal, known for her villainous facial expressions, from the Canadian computer-animated TV series Reboot. The production’s writer and director, Rizwan Mohuiddin, also voices the character.

Additional collaborators on this project include Susannah Haight (Costume Consultant); Emmett Verhoog (Original Score/Sound Mixing); Ileanna Cheladyn (Rehearsal Director/Movement Director); Jake Tkaczyk (Production Manager); Nicholas Lehmann (Cinematographer/Editor); Alexander Boldt (Ass.t Cinematographer/Editor); and Kenzie Bowes (Lighting Designer).

This film touches on serious topics and comes with a trigger warning for those sensitive to topics such as sexual assault and suicide.\
