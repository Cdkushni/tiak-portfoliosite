An atmospheric exploration into a liminal theatre of happenstances sometimes involving Elon Musk, a dummy body, and 25 fluorescent office lights, **FEED** wrestles with identity and circumstance entangled with Western societal ideologies to reveal a performative ungrounding of everyday rhythms. Featuring an original score from experimental noise duo Pigeon Breeders live mixed by MORRISMORRIS and interpreted by some of Alberta’s most virtuosic performers, **FEED** sears tableaus of wonder nestled within mundane horror to stretch the limitations of expectation and perception from a proudly Albertan perspective.
