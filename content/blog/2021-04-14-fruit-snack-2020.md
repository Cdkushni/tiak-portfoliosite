*featuring Shammy Belmore, Ora Burns, Hannah Chyz, Sarah Emslie, Elya Hunt, and Eric Pinkerton*

Fruit Snack is an absurd, candy-coloured journey following six kids as they search for their very own paradise, while they grapple with the idea of what that really means. As time passes, they are forced to confront what is holding them back, and question if paradise even exists at all. This film is a snapshot of a dance piece of the same name.\
