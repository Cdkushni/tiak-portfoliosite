*Deep Sea Research in Progress* (*DSRIP*) is a collaboration between Jenna Berlyn Mazur, Tia Ashley Kushniruk, and Kenzie Bowes. Initially inspired by the ideals of 'Beauty' and 'Beauty' in dark times, this work seeks to exploit the aesthetic reign of colonial western dance standards in contemporary concert dance using a variety of zany characters, motifs and relationships to metaphorically posture how to reclaim what is truly 'beautiful' to you. 

Created in a devised space, this work was built together with:

Kevin 'Shazam' Li, Juolin Lee, Calder White, Ileanna Cheladyn, and Susannah Haight. 

*DSRIP* had it's first round of research with Left of Main (Vancouver) and is currently seeking one more creation residency, a technical residency, and a presentation opportunity. \
