# monolith

*monolith* is a live stage work between Rizwan Mohiuddin and Tia Ashley Kushniruk. Playing with consent, command, obedience, and violence, *monolith* edges the audience into uncomfortability, discomfort, and mistrust - is what you are seeing real? Or are you just trippin'? 

\
The stage work of *monolith* was created during the March/April 2021 Mile Zero Dance Crush Series, where a film adaptation of the same name, was digitally presented. 

\
The live work has yet to premiere and requires no technical residency for performance.
