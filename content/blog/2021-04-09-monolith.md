# 'a rehearsal for' monolith

*'a rehearsal for' monolith* is a Theatre/Dance duet between Rizwan Mohiuddin and Tia Ashley Kushniruk. Examining consent, command, obedience, and violence through the relationship between a director and their subordinate, *a rehearsal for' monolith* edges the audience into discomfort and mistrust of both players in the space. Who actually has power, and how far will someone go to show that power over the other?  

\
The stage work of '*a rehearsal for' monolith* was created during the March/April 2021 Mile Zero Dance Crush Series, where a film adaptation of the same name, was digitally presented. 

\
The live work has yet to premiere and requires no technical residency for performance. Email tiaakush71@gmail.com for inquires.
