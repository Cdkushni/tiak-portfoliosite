# *animus/anima* (2016)

# Created in Collaboration with Katherine Semchuk and Jocelyn Mah.

# Performed at 'Dancing in the Park 2016' Edmonton/AB

*animus/anima* involves three performers experiencing instances of feminine identity. All three performers are female identifying and presenting, initially practising classical archetypes of femininity. Throughout the work, one performer becomes a 'Bearer of Female Godliness', hoisting femininity to a level unachievable and existential by all standards of current predicates. The following 2 performers become caught within shifting dimensions of presentation, embodiment, and failure, as they oscillate around the standards of 'Female Godliness' and their own comforts. 

This work is 20 minutes long and was performed outdoors in a deep green expanse that led up a hill.
